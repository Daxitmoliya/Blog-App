      "description": "What It Is: A lifestyle blog by Erin Loechner, filled with beautifully-written essays on everything from design to parenting, marriage, work, travel and more.\n\nWhy I Love It: I’ve never met Erin before in person, but she feels like such a kindred spirit. I have enjoyed tuning into her blog for years (like, so many years now!) for a dose of real-life inspiration and lovely prose. Her posts on navigating motherhood and marriage have always been some of my favorites. But I have always especially connected with her posts on slowing down, creativity, and self-care, probably because they’re always words I need to take to heart myself. I really admire how open she has been to letting her career evolve and pivot in some big ways over the past decade, and I can’t wait to follow along wherever the next roads may lead."

      "description": "What It Is: A lifestyle blog by Joanna Goddard covering everything from style to food, design, travel, relationships and motherhood.\n\nWhy I Love It: This is another long-time read for me and one that I still completely look forward to tuning into daily. Her posts are always interesting and fun, and I always look forward to her weekend list of links. Also of note — she has really awesome readers, so the comment sections on her posts are always worth scrolling.\n\nRecommendations: Her Friday link posts. Her “Motherhood Around The World” series. All product recommendation lists (see her style and design categories, although heads up that you’ve gotta click fast on the links — her readers regularly buy out the items she loves). Everything on relationships and motherhood."

      "description": "What It Is: A lifestyle and DIY blog by Elise Blaha Cripe, full of tons of great inspiration for all things DIY (memory-keeping, home decor, knitting, photography, recipes, gardening), great resources for blogging and entrepreneurship, and an honest peek into daily life with her husband and two cute kiddos.\n\nWhy I Love It: I have been following Elise’s blog since before I even knew what a blog was. (Yeah, way back before blog readers, she was a favorite “bookmark” in my browser!)  And in that weird way that the internet brings people together, I kind of feel like we’ve “grown up together” over this past decade. It’s been fun to watch her transition from life as a single graphic designer to falling in love and getting married, having one daughter and then another, taking the leap from one creative endeavor to another to another — and sharing stories and reflections and photos of it all on her blog along the way. I just really dig the way she thinks about and appreciates life, and love her style. Now if only I could make myself finish a scrapbook…\n\nRecommendations: Every single project in her archives. Her posts on small business (these resources are great) and blogging and goal-setting. And just generally, any posts where she chats about everyday life. :)"

Fashion blogs aren’t usually my thing, but I feel like Emily posts about trendy things in a fun and helpful and accessible way. Her beauty tutorials are also always fascinating and spot-on. More than anything though (I’m realizing a theme here…), I love the posts when she shares about the relationships in her life, and all of the honest ups and downs of navigating life as a new mom.\n\nRecommendations: All of her beauty tutorials/recommendations. Her personal posts. Her DIY projects."
